Here at Mamakden we produce premium Rendang Paru for limited daily batch. Rendang is usually refer to beef rendang. But we make special kind of rendang -Rendang Paru- where beef inard (lung/paru in Indonesian) is used instead meat. The difference is not only the part of bovine to use but also ingredient, process and ultimately the taste. 

The taste: texture is everything

Different that typical Restaurant Padang rendang which more to the shade of brown, our rendang paru is dark. Where as the restaurant variant has been modified to suit the taste general public, is savory and a little bit sweet, our is more complex and is with layered flavor. It has dense savory flavor, with noticable sourness and a little bit of tanginess. Typically more salty because of souce reduction and just enough spiciness so not to overwhelmed other flavors. The texture the most interesting. The protein (lung) has a bite to it. The outer part has a little crunch with flavorfull oil bursting out on each bite. Heaven.

Ingredient and Process

Rendang has been traditionally reserved for special occasion like wedding or Eid where well of family slaughter a cow for a feast. Since this started way before the wide use of refridge, the excess carcas has to be rendang-ed (yes we use rendang as verb) as to preserve. So not to be wasteful we also cooked other parts like heart and lung. The lung dan heart are less in volume than meat. Therefore they are considered special (rarity) of what already special rendang. 

The secrets of proper rendang paru are in the process and ingridient.  In our case artisant selects the best ingredient and painstakingly prepares Rendang Paru which takes 24 hours end to end. The first third is especially gruelling, our artisant has to pay his full attention to the ingredient by stiring and scrapping it so that no un-even browing and coagulation.

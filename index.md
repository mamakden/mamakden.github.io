## Welcome to Mamak Den

![image-left](/images/rendang-horizonal-1.jpg){: .align-left}At Mamakden we produce premium Rendang Paru, for limited batch daily,following Abuhasan family receipt from Payakumbuh region, West Sumatra. 

Rendang is type of cooking where main ingredient typically meat but other may as well cooked in the coconut milk and spices until some/most coconut milk coagulate/solidify. Rendang Paru is type of rendang that made of lung instead of usual meat(beef). The different are not only the ingredients, but the process and ultimately the taste as well. 


## Taste of Mamakden Rendang Paru

Mamakden rendang is dark in color. It has complex flavors and taste. It is savory, and has a noticeable sourness with a trace of bitterness. Typically more salty because of the coconut milk reduction and touch of spiciness so not to overwhelmed. The texture is most interesting. The protein (lung) has a bite to it. It is little crunchy on initial bite and soft middle with burst of flavorful oil follows. Heaven. Some sweetness is also present if eaten with rice (which the only way rendang should be eaten) 


## Ingredient and Process

The secrets of proper rendang paru are in the process and ingredient.  We selects the best ingredient and painstakingly prepares it. The preparation can take more than 24 hours end to end. The first step of process is especially gruelling, we have to pay full attention to the ingredient by stirring and scrapping it so that no un-even browning and coagulation. Once browned we rested the rendang overnight, about 10 to 14 hours. The next day the process continue until the rendang is dark.

Other secret of rendang is it develop its flavors over time. The more days it has the better it seems. And more one reheat rendang the more it flavor developed.

## Welcome to Mamak Den

![image-left](/images/rendang-horizonal-1.jpg){: .align-left}At Mamakden we produce premium Rendang Paru, for limited batch daily,following Abuhasan family receipt from Payakumbuh region, West Sumatra. 

Rendang is type of cooking where main ingredient typically meat but other may as well cooked in the coconut milk and spices until some/most coconut milk coagulate/solidify. Rendang Paru is type of rendang that made of lung instead of usual meat(beef). The different are not only the ingredients, but the process and ultimately the taste as well. 



## Taste of Rendang

The common understanding is, rendang is originated from West Sumatra but can also be found all through Indonesia, Sumatra especially, and some part of Malaysia as well. The type/taste and process of cooking rendang can be different from area-to-area, region to region, even from family-to-family. The typical rendang, especially restaurant kind, is brown. Our Rendang Paru, however, is dark. Its typically brown because darker one takes additional days to cook. Thus more time consuming.

One reason to have brown rendang is to retain sweetness, this suit wider taste. But our rendang is dark. It is more complex in taste and has layered flavors. Savory is the dominant flavor, noticeable sourness and a little bit of bitterness. Typically more salty because of the coconut milk reduction and touch of spiciness so not to overwhelmed. The texture is most interesting. The protein (lung) has a bite to it. It is little crunchy on initial bite and soft middle with burst of flavorful oil follows. Heaven. 
 

## Ingredient and Process

Rendang has been traditionally reserved for special occasion like wedding or Eid where well of family slaughter a cow for a feast. Before the use of fridge, the excess carcass has to be rendang-ed (yes we use rendang as verb) as to preserve. So not to be wasteful we also cooked other parts like heart and lung. The lung and heart are less in volume than meat. Therefore they are considered special (rarity) of what already special rendang. 

The secrets of proper rendang paru are in the process and ingredient.  In our case artisan selects the best ingredient and painstakingly prepares Rendang Paru which takes 24 hours end to end. The first third is especially gruelling, our artisan has to pay his full attention to the ingredient by stirring and scrapping it so that no un-even browning and coagulation.
